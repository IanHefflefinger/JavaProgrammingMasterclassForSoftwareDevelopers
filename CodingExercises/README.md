#Coding Exercises

CodingExercises contains projects that were created to pass unit tests (blind) written by Tim Buchalka on his Udemy course. The challenges are built around different concepts in Java and get progressively more difficult as the course proceeds.


How it works:

-Each project starts with a requirements definition around a specific goal(s) for the project.

-Java code is submitted through the Udemy platform

-Java code is tested by Tim's unit tests on the backend

-Code passes tests as "successful" or individual unit test errors are presented on the screen (the unit tests are not visible - only the result)
